## About

Algorithms and programming: this is a hand book written on my first year
 in Lebanese University Faculty of Science.  

 It contain the basic of **'C'** languages, with some questions, solutions, and comments
 around.. Hoping that programing become easy and lovely!  

This is not a software project, but it is on GitHub so curious students get
to know about its magic in coordination while doing projects...
And later on for (Who is Interested) can **contribute** in the project: Adding
new solutions and sessions...

```bash
Thanks to 'Lebanese University - Faculty of Science',
This is the least that i can do,
Grateful student Ahmad Said.
